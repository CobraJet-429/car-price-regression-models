# Car Price Prediction with Traditional Regression Models

This project explores different traditional regression models to predict the prices of new/used cars based on various features. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model training using Scikit-Learn. The goal is to compare model performance and understand which approaches work best for this type of dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains listings of used cars, with 11,000+ entries and 15 features including brand, model, year, mileage, and more. The target variable is the car price.

- **License**: *Unknown*  
  The dataset is not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. To use it, please download it directly from the Kaggle link above and place it in a `data/` folder.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CobraJet-429/car-price-regression-models.git 
   cd car-price-regression-models
                                                                          
2. **Download the dataset manually** from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset) and place the CSV file in the `data/` folder.

3. **(Optional)**: Create and activate a virtual environment
